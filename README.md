# Data Structures and Selection Sort Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures and selection algorithms.

## Directory Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

1. **data_structures** - Contains implementations for fundamental data structures - Arrays, Linkedlist, Matrix, Queue, and Stack. 
2. **Selection_Sort** - Contains implementations for deterministic and randomized selection algorithms.

### Files:
- **deterministic_selection_algorithm.py**: Implementation of the selection algorithm for deterministic cases.
- **randomized_selection_algorithm.py**: Implementation of the selection algorithm for randomized cases.
- **randomized_selection_vs_deterministic.py**: Comparison between randomized and deterministic selection algorithms.
- **selection_algorithms_report.pdf**: A PDF document containing the analysis and comparison of the deterministic and randomized selection algorithms.

## Running the Code

To test the implementations:

### 1. Selection_Sort (Part 1 of the Assignment)
- Navigate to the `Selection_Sort` directory.
- Run `deterministic_selection_algorithm.py` to test the implementation of deterministic selection sort. There is a main method defined with a sample test input, so that output is generated after the code is run. 
  ```bash
  python3 deterministic_selection_algorithm.py
  ```
- Run `randomized_selection_algorithm.py` to test the implementation randomized selection sort. There is a main method defined with a sample test input, so that output is generated after the code is run. 
  ```bash
  python3 randomized_selection_algorithm.py
  ```
- Run `deterministic_vs_randomized.py` to test the implementation of comparision between deterministic and randomized selection algorithns. This has a graphichal inferface used as output, so after the run of this code, a graph is produced to visualize comparision between deterministic and randomized selection sort. 
  ```bash
  python3 deterministic_vs_randomized.py
  ```
  
  


- The code will output basic implementation of all the data structure used and implemented. 

### 2. data_structures (Part 2 of the Assignment)
- Navigate to the `data_structures` directory.
- Run `main.py` to test the implementation of arrays, linked lists, matrices, queues, and stacks.
  
  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```
- The code will output basic implementation of all the data structure used and implemented.
